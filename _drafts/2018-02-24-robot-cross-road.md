Carer drone Phantom today became the first drone to help a senior citizen cross the road.

The carer robot was programmed to wait at the crossing and offer assistance if requested.

Isako (いさ子), 78, approached the crossing at 14:32 PM and completed it 23 seconds later with Phantom's assistance.

Phantom was even able to thank stopping drivers with a wave.

Phantom's creators were testing the functionality for release of new carer drones that could be available within five years.
