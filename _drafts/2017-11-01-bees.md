Many of heard that bee populations have decreased in the last few years.

But few know that one of the primary causes is blindness.

Bees partly rely on their vision to find flowers to pollinate.

This means that blind bees often accidentally try to pollinate other objects such as children and ice-cream.

The experience is often confusing and traumatic for bumblebees who might believe they have just landed on another Orchid or Periwinkle.

But scientists have been working on hybrid variants of flowers that are easier for bees to detect.

Through vibrations of its leaves the flower variant is able to transmit a small buzzing sound.

The buzzing sound roughly translates to the word flower in 'bee language'.

While these are just early days, scientists at the research centre in Cambridge UK are confident that the flower variants could be grown around the world.

Quality of life for blind bumblebees may be about to get a whole lot better.
