Glitter – not to be confused with the same substance found in party bags and pride parades – is the non-scientific name for Glycerol-Oxate, a recently discovered anti-body that is being described as a breakthrough in cancer research.

The substance gets its name for its shiny appearance that closely resembles glitter.

It is a naturally occurring chemical produced by a breed of horse most common in Lithuania.

Glycerol-Oxate is found in the tear glands of the Lithuanian Quarter Horse, now referred to by some as "Unicorns" for their near-miraculous properties.  

Once ingested glitter targets cancerous cells and fights them by converting their most hazardous chemical into more "glitter".

A research lab in Geneva says successful trials have already been carried out on wing cancers in birds such as canaries and woodpeckers.

Human trials could begin within the next few years, with the cure potentially available as soon as 2025.
