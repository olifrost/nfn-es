Averageness affects as many as 8 in 10 people, but until recently it was never recognised as a medical condition.

Averageness is when a person is not physically or mentally handicapped, but their natural ability prevents them achieving anything.

People with averageness can even seem genuinely talented at some skills.

Yet when it comes to actually succeeding, other factors prevent them such as Poor Personality or Lack of Motivation.

But the recent recognition of Averageness in the medical profession may have led to a treatment.

Scientists conducted a study comparing the neural structures of both successful and average people.

The study found that more successful people's brains had higher levels Benzoylmethylecgonine.

Test mice given supplements of the chemical became better at solving mazes or finding cheeses.

If the treatment is also effective in humans it could mean more people working in the job they want but will never get into.

Since the results the government has offered over $15 million in funding to further research.
