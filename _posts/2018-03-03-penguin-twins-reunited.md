Shrimpy and Fishcakes, two emperor penguins, were separated shortly after birth following a mile-long iceberg split in 2010.

The two lived apart for seven years on opposite ends of Antarctica, until one eagle-eyed explorer for The Antarctica Survey noticed an unusual likeness between the colouring under their wings.

After finding out the penguins were related through a DNA test, The Antarctica Survey arranged a visitation for the penguins by helicopter.

The Antarctica Survey claim that the two penguins both got on well, and shortly became friends. The two even shared similar interests, with both showing an inclination for the same kinds of seafood â€“ especially krill.

The two penguins shared their birthday together before returning to their packs.

The researchers plan to keep the penguins in touch with monthly Skype calls.
