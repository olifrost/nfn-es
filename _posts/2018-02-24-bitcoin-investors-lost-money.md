Bitcoin (â‚¿) is a cryptocurrency, a form of electronic cash, invented by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto, and released as open-source software in 2009.

Many people live with regret at not investing early in Bitcoin after news reports claimed that $100 of bitcoin in 2010 would be worth $75 million today.

And while the price of Bitcoin has since fallen greatly, many still feel jealously at those who invested early.

However, according to a survey of early Bitcoin owners conducted by Coinbase, over 92% of early investors lost money.

A combination of a volatile market, the proliferation of "altcoins", and hacking incidents, meant few were able to benefit from the increase in value.

While the news may not bring confidence to Bitcoin owners, it may help those feeling they missed out to sleep better at night.
