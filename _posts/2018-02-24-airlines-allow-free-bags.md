Airline baggage limits was ranked the number one frustration by fliers in a survey last year. The high cost of taking hold bags has forced passengers to overload their hand luggage, which come under heavy restrictions.

This means that many planes fly with empty space in their holds while passengers spend hours finding the best way to fit everything into their carry ons.

However, following talks between major airlines last year, this could soon change. Airlines plan to offer free hold luggage in the days before the flight, provided there is remaining room.

The policy was originally put forward by Norwegian Airlines and United, AA, BA, Emirates are all expected to follow, as well as some budget airlines like Easyjet.

The news goes against a recent trend in air travel to add hidden costs throughout the journey, and marks a return in the industry to customer-focussed thinking.
