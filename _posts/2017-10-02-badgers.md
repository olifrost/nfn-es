Yes, that's right. Humans aren't the only ones that start to recede in the early 20s.

And after a blogger posted a picture of a bald badger on Twitter last week, the twittersphere went into a meltdown.

Not only are many of these badgers bald, but many are also over-worked.

Baldness carries much of the same stigma amongst badgers as in our own society – with the bald badgers delegated many of the tougher jobs, such as burrowing.

A GoFundMe, set up to try and raise money to buy toupés for the badgers, was funded almost immediately.

The toupés, available in black, white, and white and black are set to start manufacture in the next year.
