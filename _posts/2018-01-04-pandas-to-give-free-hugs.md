description: A zoo in China has started a "free hug" policy.

---

A zoo in China announced this month it will offer free hugs from its resident panda, koala, and polar bears.

The zoo says it will offer the hugs to "anyone with a ticket in need of a hug".

The 拥抱 initiative (translation: "Bear Hugs") will let visitors enter the pens of the animals for the first time.

The animals have been specially trained in giving out hugs to humans.

One visitor claimed to have heard a panda bear give a high pitched growl that sounded like he was saying "Come here".

Analysts predict the scheme could give out as many a 1 million bear hugs by the end of the year.
