Derrick Errol Evans, also known as Mr Motivator, was a fitness instructor famous for his fitness and workout videos in the 1990s.

He is well remembered for wearing tight fitting and very colourful spandex outfits in his fitness sessions.

Today he announces his first release in nearly two decades, but this time it's not people he's training.

Mr Motivator's new workout video will focus on workout programmes for obese kittens and puppies.

The video, targeted both at pets and their owners, will give daily workouts for keeping in shape.

In an early video screener shown to NFN, Mr Motivator is seen in a park throwing sticks for his spaniel set to the track La Macarena.

In other scene we see Mr Motivator's "patented" kitten string workout.

Analysts say the video series may could reduce kitten and puppy obesity by as much as 65% by 2020.

The series is set to be released in early 2018.
