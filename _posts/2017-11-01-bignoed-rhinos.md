In the Namibia region of South Africa the rhinos faced a unique problem.

Evolutionary factors caused the rhinos to develop noses much bigger than usual rhinos.

Big-nosed rhinos suffered from social exclusion and were less likely to find a mate than smaller nosed rhinos.

So the local population stepped in to help.

After a fundraising drive the village was able to pay for the affected rhinos to undergo minor plastic surgery that would reduce the size of the nose and horn area.

Since the operation many of the rhinos have been able to rejoin their packs.

One rhino, Gerard, gave birth to his first child last week.

Locals who knew the pack well reported that Gerard's mate would likely have been "out of his league" before the operation.

A competition has been started in the nearest village to name the new baby rhino, with more babies expected
by the end of the year.
