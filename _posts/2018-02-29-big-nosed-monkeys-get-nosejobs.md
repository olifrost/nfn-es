description: Locals fund operation for indigenous population.

Big-nosed monkeys are endemic to the Southeast Asian island of Borneo, and live amongst normal monkeys.

Early last year, conservationists noticed that big-nosed monkeys suffered from social exclusion and were less likely to find a mate than their smaller nosed counterparts.

After the findings were made public, the local population stepped in to help.

After a fundraising drive the village was able to pay for the monkeys to undergo minor plastic surgery that would reduce the size of the nose area.

Since the operation many of the monkeys have been able to return to their packs and find new mates.

One monkey, Imala, gave birth to her first child last week.

Locals who knew the pack well reported that Imala's mate would likely have been "out of her league" before the operation.

A competition has been started in the nearest village to name the new baby monkey, with more babies expected
by the end of the year.
