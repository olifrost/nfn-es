After Friends was re-released onto Netflix in the UK in 2017 there was a backlash about sexist, homophobic and transphobic attitudes within the show that were given a free pass when it first aired in the 90s.

But today Netflix announced that Friends, along with other historical content, will come with the option of watching a re-cut version that is free from these scenes. This means that some episodes will have a shorter running time, or could be cut entirely.

This includes the long running storyline that Chandler is gay, and Joey and Ross remarking 'No Homo' every time they hug.

This is not the first time Netflix has re-edited content to make up for past mistakes. This year it released a new cut of Arrested Development Season 4 that was made to be more faithful to the style of the original show.

Among the other shows to get a recut are Little Britain, The Office and Will & Grace.

Netflix will give viewers the choice of watching both the original and new edit, using an option found in parental control settings. The changes are live starting today in all regions where the shows are available.
