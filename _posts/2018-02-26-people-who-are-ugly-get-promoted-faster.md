description: Research shows less attractive people earn 23% more.

In 2012 a poll showed that 74% of people believe their more attractive peers would climb faster in their careers.

But a new study, released yesterday by the United Workers Union, now offers evidence to the contrary.

The study plotted workers attractiveness on a scale of 1-10 against their pay grade.

The results showed that less attractive people had on average a 23% higher wage, split evenly across men and women after taking into account other factors, such as gender pay disparity.

The study also tracked the average rate of promotion, finding that less attractive people were promoted on average ever 1.8 years, compared to 2.1 for more attractive people.

While there is little historical data on the matter, the researchers believe that changing attitudes in the workplace have created a shift towards talent as a focus for promotion.

The researcher further speculated that less attractive people have a greater motivation to succeed because of their lack of natural "advantages" in their looks.

The study is set to continue over the next ten years.
