A new report published by the Royal Institute of Health & Wellness has revealed the positive impacts watching Netflix has on our health and well-being.

The study was based on a census of 10,000 millennials over the course of two years.

While many saw binge-watching their favourite shows as a guilty pleasure that "rots their brain", the report claims Netflix offers more benefits to our well being than reading or going to university.

The paper informing the study claims to have taken inspiration from ancient Greek philosophy's ideas on "mimesis", or imitation.

 > "In watching Netflix, millennials learn to imitate the skills and personalities they see. As most characters in online shows are smarter, funnier, and better in bed than normal people, this presents an opportunity for learning"

The results that follow are mostly unsurprisingly.

Viewers that watched House of Cards became better at politics.

Viewers that watched Mad Men became better at picking up the opposite sex.

And viewers that watched Sherlock generally became better at solving crimes and other detective work.

As Netflix is watched after work and all day at weekends by many millennials, the report is welcome news.

The full report is set to be published at the end of the month along with a companion book that pairs learning interests with shows on the streaming service.
